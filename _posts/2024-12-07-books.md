 I spend the last five years or so wondering what issues I had that din’t let me concentrate or focus at work or just doing anything in life.I started trying to research the similar symptoms and came across ADHD. I have heard of it but, growing up, I always heard how bad the medicine was and that you will be a zombie and end up being a drug addict. I wish those comments dint existed and better tools were available to find help. Trying to do homework or take a test was like trying to insert the fabric through the needle with shaking hands and being told “do better!”. The other thing I would do as an adult is talk about things that I enjoyed. Things like tech or sci fi and get very excited but, being told to lower my voice. I never thought it was an issue but, even people at work would tell me “shh lower your voice”.
